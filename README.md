# Nano Streamlit

This is a ~mini~ nano example of how to explore and display discoverings from a dataset.

All documentation will be in the code, I hope.

## SetUp

Install streamlit (you could follow their simple [instructions](https://streamlit.io/#install))

> ```bash
> pip install streamlit
> streamlit run nano.py
> ```
